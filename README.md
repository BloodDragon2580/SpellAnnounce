SpellAnnounce posts specific spells and interrupts in the chat so other people 
can see what you interrupted and/or what spell you used.


SpellAnnouncer is still in the early stages of development. 
If someone has changes or improvements, 
they are welcome to write them on my GitHub page. 
I'm always looking for support for my other addons. 
So if you can program and are interested, just get in touch.
